# Quant Trading App
> I developed a trading tool used to compete in the TMX Options trading contest hosted from September 18 to November 10, 2023. Over the 8 weeks, I implemented and applied multiple indicator based trading strategies including RSI, MACD, gap trading methodologies. There were additions made to include a web-based backtesting tool, along with a simple correlation heatmap for mean reversion strategies.

## General Information
- The purpose of this project was to provide live quantitative insights accessible from anywhere to assist with live trading. It was built on top of free API market data and served as a tool for options pricing, and trade backtesting.  
- I undertook this development beause we were functioning in a team of technical and non-technical traders and wanted to level the playing field for everyone to have access to the same resources.

## Project Status
Project is: no longer being worked on. Improvements may be made in the future, specifically on the backtesting tool. I plan to study trading algorithms in further depth, and will rewrite a significant portion of the existing trading strategies in this repository.
